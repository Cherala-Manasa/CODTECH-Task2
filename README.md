### Project: Hospital Management System
![task2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bab29780-33a0-401e-883b-e885e1fd3e0a)

### Objective
The Hospital Management System is a Java-based console application designed to streamline hospital operations such as patient management, appointment scheduling, billing and invoicing, inventory management, and staff management. This project simulates key operations within a hospital environment by allowing users to manage records efficiently and interactively through a menu-driven system.

### Key Activities
- **Patient Management:** Registered new patients with unique IDs, names, ages, and genders. Enabled viewing and updating patient details.  
- **Appointment Scheduling:** Scheduled patient appointments with doctor details, date, and time. Implemented an automatic generation of appointment IDs.  
- **Billing and Invoicing:** Developed a system to create invoices for patients, storing details like invoice ID, patient ID, and billing amount.  
- **Inventory Management:** Managed hospital inventory by adding items, updating quantities, and displaying available stock.  
- **Staff Management:** Registered staff members with unique IDs, names, and roles (doctor, nurse, etc.).  
- **Data Management:** Used Java Collections like HashMap to store and retrieve patient, appointment, invoice, inventory, and staff records.  

### Technologies Used
- **Java:** The primary programming language used to build the system.  
- **Java Collections (HashMap):** For efficient data storage and retrieval.  
- **Scanner:** For capturing user input through the console.  
  
### Key Insights
- **Efficient Data Handling:** Utilizing Javaâ€™s HashMap allows for quick and dynamic access to various hospital records.  
- **User Experience:** A menu-driven interface makes the program intuitive and user-friendly, enabling easy navigation across various functionalities.  
- **Scalable Design:** The use of modular methods ensures the program can be easily extended to add new features like medical history or prescriptions.  
- **Code Maintainability:** Implementing distinct classes for each entity (Patient, Appointment, Invoice, etc.) enhances the readability and structure of the program.  

### Features
- **Patient Registration:** Store patient details (ID, name, age, gender) and retrieve them when needed.  
- **Appointment Scheduling:** Schedule and manage appointments with unique appointment IDs, patient IDs, and doctor details.  
- **Billing and Invoicing:** Generate invoices with automatic ID assignment and calculate billing amounts.  
- **Inventory Management:** Add new inventory items, update quantities, and view current stock levels.  
- **Staff Management:** Add, view, and update staff information (ID, name, role).  
- **View All Records:** Display all records (patients, appointments, invoices, inventory, staff) for easy management.  

### Future Enhancements
- **Database Integration:** Add persistent storage to retain data across sessions using a database like MySQL or MongoDB.  
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Introduce a GUI to enhance user interaction and usability.  
- **Advanced Features:** Add functionality for tracking doctor availability, storing detailed medical records, and managing prescriptions.
